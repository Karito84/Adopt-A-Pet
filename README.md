# Codecademy Project completed using React Router v6

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

In this project, I practiced using React Router v6 to add client-side routing to a React Application. I worked on a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets. Codeacademy included a starter code and instructions for React Router v5.

### Tasks 

First, I had to update the instructions to work with React Router v6.

Next, I had to add client-side routing to the application using React Router so that: <br>
* The HomePage component responds to the browser’s current URL by displaying only pets of the species the user wishes to view.<br>
* The PetDetailsPage page displays when the browser’s current URL includes a specific pet’s id.<br>
* The PetDetailsPage displays data for the correct pet based on the id in the URL parameters’ values.<br>
* When the user searches for a pet in the search bar, they are redirected to the SearchPage, which uses the query parameter called name to filter pets by name.<br>
* When a user clicks a pet whose details are not available, they are redirected to a PetNotFoundPage.<br>
* From the PetNotFound page, users can click “Go Back” button that will take them to page they were previously on.<br><br>
